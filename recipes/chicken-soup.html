                Saute onion and garlic in the hot oil until softened, 
                3 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add chicken broth, chicken breasts, lemon zest, and red pepper flakes 
                to the pot. Increase heat to high, cover, and bring to a boil. Reduce 
                heat to medium and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in pearl couscous, salt, 
                and pepper. Simmer for 5 minutes more. Remove from heat.</li>
